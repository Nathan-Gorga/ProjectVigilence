RASPBERRY PI 4 TECH SPECS

1.8GHz clock
1GB RAM (can be more but for our project we will stick to that)

supports mutlithreading

ARM processor

PROJECT REQUIREMENTS

sampling frequency= 200 Hz

3 channels

channel point type : float

IMPLICATIONS

12 bytes intake per sampling point

* 200 Hz

2400 bytes in 1 second of real time data

having 1GB of RAM, that means we can store 

around 115 hours of real time data in RAM

1 clock cycle of the raspberry pi is 0.55ns

in between each data point, there are 138 643 clock cycles
